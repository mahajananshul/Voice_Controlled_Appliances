# Voice_Controlled_Appliances
This project is based on automation of home appliances for the ease of people. The key objective of our system design is to provide easy means to control and operate appliances. Since people with specific disabilities and old age people need attendants most of the time to look for their appliance switching needs, we require a system which is affordable, mobile and simple to implement. This system is designed using Android which will send the captured voice input to Arduino UNO via Bluetooth module. An android application is made which uses Googleâ€™s voice recognition and Arduino Uno processes the voice input to control the home appliances. Here in our project, we have used Arduino UNO R3 along with voice recognition of an android phone and the connection between them is established using Bluetooth module (HC-05). A 4-channel relay is used to drive the ac appliances by providing the arduino output to it along with the ac supply.
